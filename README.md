# travel-logger

A fullstack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React.js and Node.js) application created for the purpose of allowing users
to leave logs of locations that they have travelled to on a world map.

As we can see above, users can click on a certain location and leave a log on the map at that position. Users can detail information such 
as the date they went to that location, the name of the exact tourist attraction that they went to, a picture of the location they went to, and
a small description of their experience at that location. Since this is a fullstack application, user information saves within the database if
you close the page, so it's a very convenient method of storing your information.
